- Instream adapter for String to improve performance of Parser in comparison to StringIO?
- Stream allocation method could be refactored as a public function in krypt_io.c
- Use long instead of int for lengths, even if not compatible with JRuby. It's just a runtime 
  difference, not one by specification?
